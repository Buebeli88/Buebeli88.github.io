Add font awesome icon
Font Awesome icons are saved as CSS classes. They are placed into an HTML document by adding an <i> tag with two classes: fa and fa-icon-name, where fa-icon-name refers to the icon-specific class name.

Review

In this lesson, we covered the basics of the Font Awesome icon library. The library contains a large selection of icons with additional classes for sizing, listing, and animating.
Although the library provides a large supply of icons and tools, it’s important to understand that few icons are truly universal. Here are a few best practices to help you anticipate and plan for user misunderstanding:
    1. Research the icon in question. When in doubt, check to see if the icon shows up on other popular sites.
    2. Use a word or two next to the icon for additional context.
If you keep this in mind, you should be in a good position to produce attractive and intuitive websites.
Let’s take a minute to review some of the concepts from this lesson:
    1. The Font Awesome library can be linked to an HTML document from a remote CDN or a local CSS file.
    2. Font Awesome icons are added to a website by setting an <i> tag’s classes to fa and fa-icon-name, where fa-icon-name refers to the icon-specific class name.
    3. Font Awesome icons can be resized using fa-lg, fa-2x, fa-3x, fa-4x, or fa-5x.
